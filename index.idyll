# Idyll Sankey Diagram

This is a demonstration of a high-performance Sankey diagram built with Canvas rendering and d3-sankey layout, featuring intelligent label placement with collision detection.

## AMOC Temperature Impact Table

This interactive table shows the impact of AMOC (Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation) weakening on temperatures in Western and Northern European countries.

[var name:"amocDecrease" value:15 /]

### AMOC Strength Decrease: [Display value:amocDecrease format:".0f" /]%

[Range value:amocDecrease min:0 max:100 step:1 /]

[AMOCTemperatureTable amocDecrease:amocDecrease /]

The slider controls the percentage decrease in AMOC strength from year 1950 baseline (0% = no change, 100% = complete shutdown). Research indicates AMOC has declined by approximately 15-20% since 1950, with a long-term trend of ~0.4 Sv per decade (Rahmstorf et al., 2015; Caesar et al., 2018).

## About

This visualization shows energy and emissions flows with advanced labeling features:

### Core Features
- **Canvas rendering** with `requestAnimationFrame` loop for smooth performance
- **d3-sankey** for layout computation
- **Hover highlights** with efficient hit testing
- **Color strategies**: source, target, or gradient
- **Negative value support**: Render with dashed strokes when `allowNegative` is true
- **Smart filtering**: `minValue` filters out tiny flows
- **Label normalization**: Consistent title case for all labels
- **Performance optimization**: Auto-disables shadows for datasets with >5000 links

### Smart Label Features (NEW!)
- **Collision detection**: Labels automatically reposition to avoid overlaps
- **Hover labels**: Small flows show labels on hover instead of cluttering the view
- **Detached labels**: Labels can float in whitespace with leader lines when needed
- **Prioritized placement**: Larger nodes get label priority
- **Contrast-aware text**: Labels have backgrounds for readability
- **Text truncation**: Long labels are truncated with ellipsis
- **Performance optimized**: Spatial indexing and caching for 10k+ links

Hover over nodes and links to see highlights with unit labels! Small nodes will show their labels on hover.
