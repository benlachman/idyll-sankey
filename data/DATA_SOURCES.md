## Notes

1. All costs are adjusted for inflation to 2020 USD
2. Costs represent global weighted averages where available
3. Learning rates are calculated from the fitted trend lines in log-log space
4. The formula used is: Learning Rate = (1 - 2^slope) Ã— 100%
5. Capacity data represents cumulative global installed capacity in megawatts

## Methodology

Data points were selected to represent meaningful observations across the learning curve for each technology. Where annual data was not available, biennial or other intervals were used to ensure adequate representation of the cost-capacity relationship while maintaining data quality.
